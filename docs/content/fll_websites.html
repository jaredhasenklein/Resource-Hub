  <ul><li><b>Techbrick</b>
     <br>Techbrick provides amazing FLL resources each year and links to other resources around the web. That site was much of my inspiration for starting
   the Resource Hub. <a class="btn btn-primary" href="http://techbrick.com">Visit <b>Techbrick</b></a></li>
   <li><b>EV3 Lessons/FLL Tutorials</b>
      <br>Tutorials for every component of FLL <a class="btn btn-primary" href="http://flltutorials.com/">Visit <b>FLL Tutorials</b></a> <a class="btn btn-primary" href="http://ev3lessons.com/en/">Visit <b>EV3 Lessons</b></a></li>
      <li><b>FLL Share & Learn Facebook group</b>
         <br>A global community of FLL mentors and volunteers. Please note: this group has very strict rules and often restricts the extent that people are able to help
         each other. Please read the rules as the admins take them very seriously.<a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FLLShareandLearn">Visit <b>FLL Share & Learn</b></a></li>
         <li><b>Robot Mats Family of Products</b>
            <br>Training mats for FLL, brought to you by the folks over at Techbrick. Robot Mats for FLL practice, Creative Playmats for kids, and Empower Mats for visually impaired students in robotics.
            <i>Disclaimer: Robot Mats has been a sponsor of my websites in the past. However, them appearing on this list is <b>not</b> a result of the sponsorship. They really are one of my
              favorite FLL sites.</i> <a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://robotmats.com/">Visit <b>Robot Mats</b></a> <a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://store.creativeplaymats.com/">Visit <b>Creative Playmats</b></a> <a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://empowermats.com/">Visit <b>Empower Mats</b></a></li>
              <li><b>STOW-or-GO Portable Table</b>
                 <br>Build a portable table you can fit in your car and bring it to events to practice. Check out these detailed (but dated) instructions. <a class="btn btn-primary" href="http://theinventioneers.blogspot.com/2010/09/stow-or-go-home-practice-table-update.html">Visit <b>STOW-or-GO instructions</b></a></li>
                 <li><b>Northern California FLL Shop</b>
                    <br>The Northern California region of FLL sells used game boards and other valuable components at a discount. Old FSKs can be very expensive
                    so if you are looking for one to buy, this is a good place to start. <a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://www.norcalfll.org/shop/">Visit <b>NorCal FLL Shop</b></a></li></ul>
