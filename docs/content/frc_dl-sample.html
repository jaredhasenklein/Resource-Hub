  <h1>Dean's List Sample Questions</h1>
    <h6><a href="https://hub.jaredhk.com">Home</a> > <a href="https://hub.jaredhk.com/docs">Resource Hub Documents</a></h6>
  <i>These questions are <u>not</u> a comprehensive list. Please look for other resources
    to suplement this. Your judges could ask all or none of these questions. They are just meant to get the ball rolling.</i>
    <br><br><b>Tip:</b> Interviews go by very quickly and the judges will probably not ask this many questions. Be sure to get
    out everything you feel you <b>must</b> get out within your first few answers.
