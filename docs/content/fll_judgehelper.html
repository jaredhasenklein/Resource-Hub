  <h1>What to look for as a judge in FLL</h1>
    <h6><a href="https://hub.jaredhk.com">Home</a> > <a href="https://hub.jaredhk.com/docs">Resource Hub Documents</a></h6>
  <i>This resources is intended for <b>judges, <u>not</u> teams</b>. I will not stop teams from looking at this but you should
  not consider this in your preperation for competitions. Judges are given a variety of things to look out for and this is just
a suplement. Judges: always ask your Judge Adviser for what they want you to look out for beyond these categories. Don't know
how to look for these things? Consider the <a href="fll_sample.html">sample questions</a>.</i>
