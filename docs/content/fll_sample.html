  <h1>FLL Sample Questions</h1>
    <h6><a href="https://hub.jaredhk.com">Home</a> > <a href="https://hub.jaredhk.com/docs">Resource Hub Documents</a></h6>
  <i>These questions are <u>not</u> a comprehensive list. If you are a team member or mentor, please look for other resources
    to suplement this. Your judges could ask all or none of these questions. They are just meant to get the ball rolling. If
    you are a judge, always think of your own questions, too and consult your Judge Adviser for more information.</i>
    <br><br><b>Also:</b> Many of these questions should be answered without the judges needing to ask. Try to cover as much of these
      questions (and other potential questions) during the presentation.
